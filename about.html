          <br>
          If there are two things people know about Amy,
          <br>
          it's that she loves art and loves the earth.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Amy picked up a paintbrush when she was 6 years old and she hasn't looked back since. Her dream is to blend science, art, and policy together to create a more sustainable world for people and the planet. Through painting, photography, and digital design, she hopes to inspire public action on the environment. Her work has been exhibited in Chicago, Michigan, and Washington D.C. <br>
          <br> Currently she is a third-year student at the University of Chicago studying biology and public policy. She is passionate about using data-driven methods to inform effective policies on sustainable development and wildlife conservation.
          When Amy isn't studying or making art, you'll likely find her scouring thrift shops to satiate her love of old things, swing dancing to fix her two left feet, and indulging in coffee shop culture in Chicago.
